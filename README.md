Project Name = Car Price Prediction.
Technology Used  = Python was the major technology used for the implementation of machine learning concepts the reason being that there are numerous inbuilt methods in the form of packaged libraries present in python.
Problem Statement = We have to preidct the car prices of used cars so we have several information about those used cars and this particular data set contain car brand what is the brand of car. what is the year of that particular model and at what price that particular car is sold and the present price of that car and the kilometer driven, fuel type whether it is it runs on petrol diesel  compressed natural gas those kinds of things, Seller type whether the seller is an individual or a dealer in the transmission,  whether the gear system is automatic or manual and then the number of owners that particular car so these are the data set feature so using these data set using we need to train our machine learning algorithm that can find patterns in the data set so once we give new information it can predict at what price that particular used cars can be sold.
Workflow = First is data collection project so we need this car data so the data set so we need this data to feed this to our machine learning model so this data set and what are the various aspects present in this particular data set so once we have this car data set so we need to pre-process the data so we cannot feed this raw data to our machine learning algorithm so for it to understand the data so we need to do some processing so this step is called as data pre-processing once we process the data we will split this data into training data and testing data this step is called as train test split once we have splitter this data we will train our machine learning algorithm with training data and we will test or evaluate our machine learning model with this disk data so we will feed this to our regression modelin this case we are going to use two regression models so first we will train our machine learning model with the linear regression and then we will use the lasso regression model and we will compare the accuracy score or the error percentage of these models and see which model performs better for this particular data set okay so this is a regression example so the previous videos which we have seen are basically classification problems so in the case of classification problems we will predict in to which class the particular data type belongs say for example we have made a project on diabetes prediction so in that case our machine learning model will predict whether a person has diabetes or not so it is like class it just predicts its yes or no or its zero or one those kind of problems are known as classification problems this is a regression problem because we are predicting a particular value okay so we are not just predicting classes we are just predicting particular value on which the car can be sold so this is known as regression problems so we will be using linear regression and then we will be using our lasso regression and compare it okay so once we have trained our model with this regulation model with this training data we will evaluate our model then we will have a drained linear regression or lasso regression model then we will feed new data to our machine learning model so on understanding this data or on operating on this data our machine learning can predict the car price on which it can be sold.
Motivation = The automotive industry is composed of a few top global multinational players and several retailers. The multinational players are mainly manufacturers by trade whereas the retail market features players who deal in both new and used vehicles. The used car market has demonstrated a significant growth in value contributing to the larger share of the overall market. The used car market in India accounts for nearly 3.4 million vehicles per year.
Conclusion = By performing different ML models, we aim to get a better result or less error with max accuracy. Next, with the help of data visualization features were explored deeply. The relation between the features is examined.
